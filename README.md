# IP-cart: An Ecommerce Website

We made a demo project for our classmates to make them familiar with the JSP Technology. In this project, we made apis which help us to reterive and store the data form the database.
We also made User Interface in HTML and CSS. Our project has a cart which stores the product and after doing shopping, it will leads you to the billing page.
Our project includes Multiple pages, form Login page to the Billing Page.
